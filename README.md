    <h1>Easy JSON Concatenator</h1>
    <p>🤹🏽 When you have one too many json files.</p>
</div>

---

### Usage
Download `combinify.py` into the directory that has the json files you are looking to combine.

Be sure that they have the same name, but are differentiated by a number. For example, `filename-1.json`, `filename-2.json`, `filename-3.json` etc.

Then run the following command:
```shell
python3 combinify.py
```

🎉 Congrats, a new file should now be created with everything you need.
